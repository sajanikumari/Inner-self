# Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix for Current Issue

The deployment failure was caused by:
1. Mismatch between Docker and native Node.js deployment configuration
2. Missing error handling for module loading
3. Suboptimal Docker configuration

## Fixed Files

1. **Dockerfile** - Improved with better caching, security, and debugging
2. **render.yaml** - Changed to use Docker deployment
3. **server/index.js** - Added error handling for reminderScheduler loading
4. **server/utils/reminderScheduler.js** - Added error handling
5. **.dockerignore** - Created to optimize Docker builds

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)
- Uses `render.yaml` (current configuration)
- More reliable and consistent
- Better for production

### Option 2: Native Node.js Deployment
- Rename `render-native.yaml` to `render.yaml` to use this option
- Faster builds but less isolated

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in your Render dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=10000`

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Build and test Docker container
docker build -t innerself .
docker run -p 5000:5000 innerself

# Or test native
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Check the deployment logs for the "âœ… Reminder scheduler loaded successfully" message
4. If issues persist, switch to native deployment option
